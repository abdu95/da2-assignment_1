------- Notes

1. (h) Do not forget the readme files! >> (search README in PDF)
2. variables.xlsx >> what should be my variables? done. is my variables correct?
3. ii. In the end you should end up with 7 non-matched observations. I think I have more non-matched observations...
4. my dependent (y) variable is *Number of registered death* and explanatory (x) variable is *Number of registered case*.
5. which observation(s) to drop >> extreme values. 
6. what to do to change 3.386e+04 to normal number?
7. Canada and Chile NA: Princess in Canada, drop Princess first?
8. how to determine the breaks()? 
9. Choose a proper scaling (I think with this, I can get rid of e+04)
10. Show the model results >> model results are alpha and beta?
11. Read Evaluation
12. Take care when it is possible to make ln transformation: you may need to drop or change some variables >> Should I change some variables?
13. For **reasoning** and for **regression models**, should I pick one (log-log) or many (log-log + level-log)
